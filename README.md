# nexchange-linux 🐧✨  
a tiny native linux edition of [nexchange-open-client-react](https://github.com/onitsoft/nexchange-open-client-react) 💫  
no browser, no electron, just a lightweight standalone app with a cute touch 🧸

---

## 🌷 what's this?

i really loved the original nexchange client 
so i made a lil port that works as a native linux app 💻  
no dev server, no npm scripts — just build + run 💨
